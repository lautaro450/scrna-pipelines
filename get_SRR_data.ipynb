    "In case that we have paired-end reads, we need to use `--split-files` while running fasterq-dump. if the reads are single end, `--split-3` should be used instead. paired-end reads will produce as outcome two different files, `{SRR_ID}_1.fastq` and `{SRR_ID}_2.fastq`. As we could expect, single reads will produce only 1 single file as outcome.
